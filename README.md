# First_webpage
This is a simple and responsive Tech Blog webpage created using HTML and CSS. It's my first web development project, designed to practice and showcase core front-end skills. The page features a clean layout, styled components, and a focus on readability and structure â€” perfect for a blog or article-style website.
